Bean Component
------------------
The bean: component binds beans to Camel message exchanges.

A bean: endpoint cannot be defined as the input to the route; 
i.e. you cannot consume from it, 
you can only route from some inbound message Endpoint to the bean endpoint as output.
 So consider using a direct: or queue: endpoint as the input.
