Direct / camel-core
Synchronous call to another endpoint from same CamelContext.
Direct Component
The direct: component provides direct, synchronous invocation of any consumers when a producer sends a message exchange.
This endpoint can be used to connect existing routes in the same camel context.
<route id="cool">
			<from uri="file:///home/ramu/RamuWorkspace/Test/source" />
			<to uri="log:com.ramu" />
			<to uri="direct:A" />
		</route>
		<!-- and another route, you can have as many your like -->
		<route id="bar">
			<from uri="direct:A" />
			<to uri="log:com.ramu" />
			<to uri="direct:B" />
		</route>
		<route id="des">
			<from uri="direct:B" />
			<to uri="log:com.ramu" />
			<to uri="file:///home/ramu/RamuWorkspace/Test/destination" />
		</route>
		
1)routes file send to source and it move to direct A
2)direct A is inmemory queue (check in jconsole) of mbeans
3)form direct A files are move to direct B
4)form direct B files are move to destination
so direct is used for inmemory queue for syncronous message
